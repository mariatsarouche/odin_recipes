        <h1>Creamy au Gratin Potatoes</h1>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 medium russet potatoes, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, sliced into rings</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter a 1-quart casserole dish.</li>
            <li>Layer 1/2 of the potatoes in the bottom of the prepared casserole dish; season with salt and pepper. Layer onion slices over top, then top with with remaining potatoes. Season again with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Gradually whisk in flour and salt and cook, whisking constantly until raw flour flavor has cooked off, about 1 minute. Gradually add milk, about 1/4 cup at a time, whisking well after each addition to incorporate; the gradual addition and whisking of milk will help avoid lumps in your sauce.</li>
            <li>Cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in cheese all at once; continue stirring until melted, 30 to 60 seconds. Pour cheese sauce over the potatoes, and cover the dish with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender and sauce is bubbly, about 1 ½ hours.</li>
        </ol>
